# Chess.jl

Julia module that plays chess, and chess360.

The goal is to create a reasonably performance chess engine, that can generate legal moves, and play with minimal interface (i.e. in the REPL).



## History
2016 October 7 I've gotten piece movement working and displaying.  Still to do are enpassant, promotion, and testing for illegal moves that put the king in check.
